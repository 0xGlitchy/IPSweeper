This code was originally created following Heath Adams's Practical Ethical Hacking course at https://academy.tcm-sec.com/

It's limiation is that only Class C IP addresses are able to be scanned.
I wanted to expand upon it by enableing Class A and B scans.
This required additional code to read the inputed ip value and cidr notation, to properly scan.
I have managed to do this for class C, I am working on addiding in A and B.
